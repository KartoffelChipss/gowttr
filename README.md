# gowttr

A simple command line app written in go, that shows you the current weather. The app uses the data from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/) and is just a simple app for me to learn go.

## üì¶ Installation

### Build it yourself

You can install gowttr in two ways: using an install script or building it manually.

### üîß Method 1: Install via Script

Run this to download the latest release and install it:

```bash
curl -sL https://gowttr.j4n.net/install | bash
```

This will:

- [x] Download the latest compiled binary from GitHub releases

After installation, you can check if it works by running:

```bash
gowttr -h
```
